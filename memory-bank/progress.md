## Completed Work

### Planning and Architecture
- ‚úÖ Defined project scope and requirements
- ‚úÖ Created high-level architecture
- ‚úÖ Specified technical stack and constraints
- ‚úÖ Defined data models and API contracts
- ‚úÖ Outlined AWS infrastructure components
- ‚úÖ Determined NX monorepo structure
- ‚úÖ Established memory bank documentation

### Setup
- ‚úÖ Initialized NX workspace
- ‚úÖ Created basic project structure
- ‚úÖ Installed NX plugins (@nx/react, @nx/node)
- ‚úÖ Generated package structure

### API Implementation
- ‚úÖ Defined shared types in shared package
- ‚úÖ Implemented Express application with routes
- ‚úÖ Created order submission endpoint
- ‚úÖ Developed analytics retrieval endpoint
- ‚úÖ Implemented recent orders endpoint
- ‚úÖ Set up serverless-http integration

### Frontend Implementation
- ‚úÖ Set up React application with Vite
- ‚úÖ Configured Tanstack Router
- ‚úÖ Implemented order form component
- ‚úÖ Created dashboard view with charts
- ‚úÖ Added CSS styling

## In Progress

- üîÑ Implementing AWS CDK infrastructure

## Pending Work

### Infrastructure
- ‚¨ú Create DynamoDB table with stream enabled
- ‚¨ú Set up S3 bucket for aggregated data
- ‚¨ú Implement Lambda function for stream processing
- ‚¨ú Configure API Gateway with Lambda integration
- ‚¨ú Deploy infrastructure using CDK

### Testing
- ‚¨ú Unit tests for backend logic
- ‚¨ú Unit tests for frontend components
- ‚¨ú Integration tests for API endpoints
- ‚¨ú End-to-end testing of complete flow

## Known Issues

- ‚ö†Ô∏è TypeScript errors related to module resolution and type definitions
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to install AWS CDK dependencies

## Next Immediate Tasks

1. Install AWS CDK dependencies:
   ```
   cd packages/cdk && npm install --save aws-cdk-lib constructs
   ```

2. Implement CDK stacks:
   - Data Storage Stack (DynamoDB)
   - S3 Stack
   - Lambda Stack
   - API Gateway Stack
   - Frontend Stack

3. Test the application locally:
   ```
   nx serve frontend
   nx serve api
   ```

4. Deploy the application using CDK:
   ```
   nx run cdk:deploy
   ```

## Success Metrics Tracking

| Metric | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| Functional Order Form | Yes | Yes | Completed |
| Real-time Data Flow | Yes | Partial | In Progress |
| Merchant-specific Analytics | Yes | Yes | Completed |
| Failed Payment Tracking | Yes | Yes | Completed |
| Hourly/Daily Granularity | Yes | Yes | Completed |
| AWS CDK Deployment | Yes | No | Not Started |

## Blockers

- ‚úì Resolved: NX plugin naming has changed (@nrwl/react ‚Üí @nx/react)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è CDK implementation and deployment

## Mitigation Strategies

1. **TypeScript Errors**: Focus on implementing the core functionality first, then address TypeScript errors
2. **AWS Configuration**: Use CDK to ensure consistent and correct configurations
3. **Cold Start Latency**: Use a single Lambda for all API endpoints to reduce cold starts
4. **Data Consistency**: Implement clear aggregation logic with timestamp-based partitioning
