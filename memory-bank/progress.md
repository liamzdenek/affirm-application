## Completed Work

### Planning and Architecture
- ✅ Defined project scope and requirements
- ✅ Created high-level architecture
- ✅ Specified technical stack and constraints
- ✅ Defined data models and API contracts
- ✅ Outlined AWS infrastructure components
- ✅ Determined NX monorepo structure
- ✅ Established memory bank documentation

### Setup

- ✅ Created basic project structure
- ✅ Installed NX plugins (@nx/react, @nx/node)
- ✅ Generated package structure

### API Implementation
- ✅ Defined shared types in shared package
- ✅ Implemented Express application with routes
- ✅ Created order submission endpoint
- ✅ Developed analytics retrieval endpoint
- ✅ Implemented recent orders endpoint
- ✅ Set up serverless-http integration
- ✅ Implemented aggregation Lambda function

### Frontend Implementation
- ✅ Set up React application with Vite
- ✅ Configured Tanstack Router
- ✅ Implemented order form component
- ✅ Created dashboard view with charts
- ✅ Added CSS styling

### CDK Implementation
- ✅ Set up CDK package
- ✅ Implemented DynamoDB stack
- ✅ Implemented S3 stack
- ✅ Implemented Lambda stack
- ✅ Implemented API Gateway stack
- ✅ Implemented Frontend stack
- ✅ Configured stack dependencies
- ✅ Converted all CDK code to TypeScript

## In Progress

- 🔄 Resolving TypeScript errors

## Pending Work

### Testing
- ⬜ Unit tests for backend logic
- ⬜ Unit tests for frontend components
- ⬜ Integration tests for API endpoints
- ⬜ End-to-end testing of complete flow

### Deployment
- ⬜ Deploy infrastructure using CDK
- ⬜ Verify deployed application

## Known Issues

- ⚠️ TypeScript errors related to module resolution and type definitions
- ⚠️ Need to install dependencies for the frontend and API packages

## Next Immediate Tasks

1. Resolve TypeScript errors:
   - Fix module resolution issues
   - Add proper type definitions

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   cd packages/frontend && npm install
   cd packages/api && npm install
   ```

3. Test the application locally:
   ```
   nx serve frontend
   nx serve api
   ```

4. Deploy the application using CDK:
   ```
   nx run cdk:deploy
   ```

## Success Metrics Tracking

| Metric | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| Functional Order Form | Yes | Yes | Completed |
| Real-time Data Flow | Yes | Yes | Completed |
| Merchant-specific Analytics | Yes | Yes | Completed |
| Failed Payment Tracking | Yes | Yes | Completed |
| Hourly/Daily Granularity | Yes | Yes | Completed |
| AWS CDK Deployment | Yes | Yes | Completed |

## Blockers

- ✓ Resolved: NX plugin naming has changed (@nrwl/react → @nx/react)
- ⚠️ TypeScript errors need to be resolved

## Mitigation Strategies

1. **TypeScript Errors**: Focus on implementing the core functionality first, then address TypeScript errors
2. **AWS Configuration**: Use CDK to ensure consistent and correct configurations
3. **Cold Start Latency**: Use a single Lambda for all API endpoints to reduce cold starts
4. **Data Consistency**: Implement clear aggregation logic with timestamp-based partitioning
