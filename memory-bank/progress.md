# Progress: Merchant Analytics Dashboard

## Project Timeline

| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| 3/19/2025 | Project Inception and Architecture Definition |
| TBD | Project Implementation |
| TBD | Project Completion |

## Completed Work

### Planning and Architecture
- âœ… Defined project scope and requirements
- âœ… Created high-level architecture
- âœ… Specified technical stack and constraints
- âœ… Defined data models and API contracts
- âœ… Outlined AWS infrastructure components
- âœ… Determined NX monorepo structure
- âœ… Established memory bank documentation

## In Progress

- ðŸ”„ Initializing NX workspace
- ðŸ”„ Setting up project packages

## Pending Work

### Infrastructure
- â¬œ Create DynamoDB table with stream enabled
- â¬œ Set up S3 bucket for aggregated data
- â¬œ Implement Lambda function for stream processing
- â¬œ Configure API Gateway with Lambda integration
- â¬œ Deploy infrastructure using CDK

### Backend
- â¬œ Implement Express application with routes
- â¬œ Create order submission endpoint
- â¬œ Develop analytics retrieval endpoint
- â¬œ Implement recent orders endpoint
- â¬œ Set up serverless-http integration

### Frontend
- â¬œ Set up React application with Vite
- â¬œ Configure Tanstack Router
- â¬œ Implement order form component
- â¬œ Create dashboard view
- â¬œ Develop charts for metrics visualization
- â¬œ Implement API integration

### Testing
- â¬œ Unit tests for backend logic
- â¬œ Unit tests for frontend components
- â¬œ Integration tests for API endpoints
- â¬œ End-to-end testing of complete flow

## Known Issues

- None yet - project is in initial planning phase

## Next Immediate Tasks

1. Initialize NX workspace with TypeScript configuration
2. Create package structure according to architecture
3. Set up shared types between packages
4. Begin implementing DynamoDB and Lambda infrastructure

## Success Metrics Tracking

|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| Functional Order Form | Yes | No | Not Started |
| Real-time Data Flow | Yes | No | Not Started |
| Merchant-specific Analytics | Yes | No | Not Started |
| Failed Payment Tracking | Yes | No | Not Started |
| Hourly/Daily Granularity | Yes | No | Not Started |
| AWS CDK Deployment | Yes | No | Not Started |

## Blockers

- None currently identified

## Risks

1. **Scope Management**: One-day timeline requires careful scope management
2. **AWS Configuration**: Ensuring proper permissions and configurations
3. **Cold Start Latency**: Potential Lambda cold start issues affecting user experience
4. **Data Consistency**: Ensuring consistent aggregation across time periods

## Mitigation Strategies

1. **Scope Management**: Focus on core functionality first, add enhancements if time permits
2. **AWS Configuration**: Use CDK to ensure consistent and correct configurations
3. **Cold Start Latency**: Use a single Lambda for all API endpoints to reduce cold starts
4. **Data Consistency**: Implement clear aggregation logic with timestamp-based partitioning
