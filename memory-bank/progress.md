## In Progress

- 🔄 Monitoring deployed application performance
- 🔄 Planning for additional features

## Pending Work

### Testing
- ⬜ Unit tests for backend logic
- ⬜ Unit tests for frontend components
- ⬜ Integration tests for API endpoints
- ⬜ End-to-end testing of complete flow

### CI/CD
- ⬜ Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing
- ⬜ Configure automated deployments on merge to main

## Known Issues

- ⚠️ No automated testing in place
- ⚠️ No CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments
- ⚠️ Limited monitoring and alerting
- ✓ Resolved: Lambda dependency bundling issues
- ✓ Resolved: Date comparison logic in analytics endpoint
- ✓ Resolved: API implementation to use DynamoDB and S3 for data storage

## Next Immediate Tasks

1. Set up CloudWatch Alarms:
   - Create alarms for Lambda errors and API Gateway 5xx errors
   - Set up notifications for high latency

2. Implement CI/CD Pipeline:
   ```
   - Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing
   - Configure automated deployments on merge to main
   ```

3. Add Additional Metrics:
   ```
   - Implement conversion rate metrics
   - Add payment plan popularity analysis
   ```

4. Enhance Security:
   ```
   - Implement API authentication
   - Add WAF protection for API Gateway
   ```

## Recent Fixes

1. **Lambda Dependency Bundling**:
   - Fixed the "Cannot find package 'express'" error
   - Updated API implementation to properly bundle dependencies
   - Added @aws-sdk/client-dynamodb to package.json

2. **API Implementation**:
   - Removed in-memory storage and updated to use DynamoDB and S3
   - Added extensive logging to help debug issues
   - Fixed date comparison logic in analytics endpoint

3. **Frontend Configuration**:
   - Created a configuration system for API base URL
   - Updated components to use the configuration
   - Simplified frontend deployment in CDK stack

## Success Metrics Tracking

| Metric | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| Functional Order Form | Yes | Yes | Completed |
| Real-time Data Flow | Yes | Yes | Completed |
| Merchant-specific Analytics | Yes | Yes | Completed |
| Failed Payment Tracking | Yes | Yes | Completed |
| Hourly/Daily Granularity | Yes | Yes | Completed |
| AWS CDK Deployment | Yes | Yes | Completed |

## Blockers

- ✓ Resolved: NX plugin naming has changed (@nrwl/react → @nx/react)
- ✓ Resolved: NX serve task for API was missing
- ✓ Resolved: TypeScript configuration for API package was incorrect
- ✓ Resolved: TypeScript errors in the codebase
- ✓ Resolved: Lambda bundling issues for deployment
- ✓ Resolved: Lambda dependency issues ("Cannot find package 'express'")
- ✓ Resolved: Date comparison logic in analytics endpoint
- ✓ Resolved: API implementation to use DynamoDB and S3 for data storage
- ⚠️ No automated testing in place

## Mitigation Strategies

1. **Automated Testing**: Implement comprehensive test suite to catch issues early
2. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up automated deployments to reduce manual errors
3. **Monitoring and Alerting**: Implement CloudWatch alarms for early detection of issues
4. **Security Enhancements**: Add API authentication and WAF protection
5. **Cold Start Latency**: Use a single Lambda for all API endpoints to reduce cold starts
6. **Data Consistency**: Implement clear aggregation logic with timestamp-based partitioning
