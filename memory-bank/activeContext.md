# Active Context: Merchant Analytics Dashboard

## Current Status

We have successfully completed the Merchant Analytics Dashboard project. The architecture has been defined and documented, the NX workspace has been initialized, and we have implemented both the frontend and API components. We have also implemented the AWS CDK infrastructure for deployment using TypeScript, configured NX project tasks for the API and CDK packages, and fixed TypeScript configuration issues. All TypeScript errors have been resolved, and the application has been successfully deployed to AWS using CDK.

We have also enhanced the analytics metrics to include counts for payment plans and products, and updated the Dashboard to display these metrics. Additionally, we've added a Recent Orders section to the Dashboard to show the most recent orders for a merchant.

## Recent Decisions

1. **Combined UI Application**: Decided to combine the order form and dashboard into a single UI application to simplify development for this demo project.

2. **Single Lambda for API**: Opted to use a single Lambda function with Express and serverless-http for all API endpoints to reduce complexity and cold start times.

3. **Specific Metrics Focus**: Defined two key metrics to focus on: Average Order Value (AOV) and Volume, with hourly and daily granularity.

4. **Merchant Granularity Requirement**: Decided to always require merchant granularity for analytics queries, removing the option to query across all merchants.

5. **TypeScript Enforcement**: Confirmed that all application code must be written in TypeScript with strict type checking. All CDK infrastructure code has been converted to TypeScript.

6. **NX Command Updates**: Updated the NX commands to use the current plugin names (@nx/react, @nx/node, @nx/js) instead of the outdated ones (@nrwl/react).

7. **Frontend Implementation**: Implemented the frontend with React, Vite, and Tanstack Router, with separate pages for the order form and dashboard.

8. **API Implementation**: Implemented the API with Express and serverless-http, with endpoints for orders and analytics.

9. **CDK Implementation**: Implemented the AWS CDK infrastructure for deployment, including DynamoDB, Lambda, API Gateway, S3, and CloudFront.

10. **Aggregation Lambda**: Implemented a Lambda function triggered by DynamoDB Streams to calculate real-time aggregates.

11. **NX Project Configuration**: Added project.json files for API and CDK packages to define tasks like serve, deploy, synth, and diff.

12. **TypeScript Configuration**: Added tsconfig.json files for API and CDK packages with proper module resolution and output paths.

13. **Enhanced Metrics**: Added counts for payment plans and products to provide more detailed analytics.

14. **Recent Orders Display**: Added a section to the Dashboard to display recent orders for a merchant.

15. **Order History Simulation**: Created a script to generate simulated order history data for the past month with natural undulations for time of day and day of week.

## Current Focus Areas

1. **Monitoring**: Setting up monitoring and alerting for the deployed application.

2. **User Testing**: Gathering feedback from users to improve the application.

3. **Performance Optimization**: Identifying and addressing performance bottlenecks.

4. **Feature Enhancements**: Planning and implementing additional features based on user feedback.
   - Added auto-refresh functionality to the Dashboard to automatically load new data every 60 seconds
   - Implemented tab focus detection to pause auto-refresh when the user is not viewing the tab
   - Added relative time display to show when data was last refreshed
   - Added manual refresh button for immediate data updates

## Key Considerations

1. **Demo Scope**: This is a one-day project meant to demonstrate technical capabilities and business value alignment, so we're focusing on core functionality without extensive error handling or edge cases.

2. **AWS Native**: All backend components are AWS native to showcase cloud architecture expertise.

3. **Real-time Data Flow**: The system demonstrates a complete data flow from order placement to visualization, emphasizing the real-time nature of the analytics.

4. **Merchant Value**: The dashboard is designed to provide clear value to merchants by helping them understand the impact of offering Affirm.

## Next Steps

1. **Set Up CloudWatch Alarms**:
   - Create alarms for Lambda errors and API Gateway 5xx errors
   - Set up notifications for high latency

2. **Implement CI/CD Pipeline**:
   ```
   - Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing
   - Configure automated deployments on merge to main
   ```

3. **Add Additional Metrics**:
   ```
   - Implement conversion rate metrics
   - Add payment plan popularity analysis
   ```

4. **Enhance Security**:
   ```
   - Implement API authentication
   - Add WAF protection for API Gateway
   ```

## Open Questions

1. **AWS Account Configuration**: How should we configure the AWS account for deployment?

2. **API Gateway Throttling**: What throttling limits should we set for the API Gateway?

3. **S3 Bucket Lifecycle**: Should we implement lifecycle policies for the S3 bucket storing aggregated data?

4. **CloudFront Distribution**: What cache settings should we use for the CloudFront distribution?
