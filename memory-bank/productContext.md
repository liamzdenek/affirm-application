# Product Context: Merchant Analytics Dashboard

## Problem Statement

Affirm merchants currently lack real-time visibility into how offering Affirm as a payment option impacts their business metrics. Without this data, merchants:

1. Cannot quantify the ROI of their Affirm integration
2. Struggle to optimize their payment option presentation
3. Miss opportunities to increase conversion rates
4. Have difficulty identifying and addressing payment failures
5. Make decisions based on intuition rather than data

## Solution Overview

The Merchant Analytics Dashboard provides real-time analytics that help merchants understand the impact of offering Affirm as a payment option. By visualizing key metrics like Average Order Value (AOV) and transaction volume, merchants can make data-driven decisions to optimize their integration and maximize business value.

## Target Users

### Primary: Merchant Business Analysts
- Need to understand the business impact of offering Affirm
- Responsible for reporting on payment method performance
- Make recommendations on payment strategy

### Secondary: Merchant Developers
- Need to troubleshoot integration issues
- Monitor for technical failures
- Optimize the implementation

## User Journey

1. **Discovery**: Merchant learns about the analytics dashboard through Affirm's merchant portal
2. **Access**: Merchant logs into the dashboard using their Affirm credentials
3. **Exploration**: Merchant explores their transaction data and performance metrics
4. **Analysis**: Merchant identifies patterns and opportunities for optimization
5. **Action**: Merchant makes changes to their integration based on insights
6. **Validation**: Merchant returns to the dashboard to verify the impact of their changes

## Key User Stories

1. As a merchant analyst, I want to see how Affirm affects my Average Order Value so that I can quantify the ROI of offering Affirm.
2. As a merchant analyst, I want to compare successful vs. failed payment rates so that I can identify and address issues affecting conversion.
3. As a merchant analyst, I want to view data at different time granularities so that I can identify both immediate issues and long-term trends.
4. As a merchant developer, I want to simulate orders with different parameters so that I can test and validate the analytics system.
5. As a merchant developer, I want to simulate payment failures so that I can verify our error handling and reporting.

1. **Increased Merchant Retention**: By providing clear value beyond payment processing, Affirm reduces merchant churn.
