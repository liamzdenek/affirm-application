# Product Context: Merchant Analytics Dashboard

## Problem Statement

Affirm merchants currently lack real-time visibility into how offering Affirm as a payment option impacts their business metrics. Without this data, merchants:

1. Cannot quantify the ROI of their Affirm integration
2. Struggle to optimize their payment option presentation
3. Miss opportunities to increase conversion rates
4. Have difficulty identifying and addressing payment failures
5. Make decisions based on intuition rather than data

## Solution Overview

The Merchant Analytics Dashboard provides real-time analytics that help merchants understand the impact of offering Affirm as a payment option. By visualizing key metrics like Average Order Value (AOV) and transaction volume, merchants can make data-driven decisions to optimize their integration and maximize business value.

## Target Users

### Primary: Merchant Business Analysts
- Need to understand the business impact of offering Affirm
- Responsible for reporting on payment method performance
- Make recommendations on payment strategy

### Secondary: Merchant Developers
- Need to troubleshoot integration issues
- Monitor for technical failures
- Optimize the implementation

## User Journey

1. **Discovery**: Merchant learns about the analytics dashboard through Affirm's merchant portal
2. **Access**: Merchant logs into the dashboard using their Affirm credentials
3. **Exploration**: Merchant explores their transaction data and performance metrics
4. **Analysis**: Merchant identifies patterns and opportunities for optimization
5. **Action**: Merchant makes changes to their integration based on insights
6. **Validation**: Merchant returns to the dashboard to verify the impact of their changes

## Key User Stories

1. As a merchant analyst, I want to see how Affirm affects my Average Order Value so that I can quantify the ROI of offering Affirm.
2. As a merchant analyst, I want to compare successful vs. failed payment rates so that I can identify and address issues affecting conversion.
3. As a merchant analyst, I want to view data at different time granularities so that I can identify both immediate issues and long-term trends.
4. As a merchant developer, I want to simulate orders with different parameters so that I can test and validate the analytics system.
5. As a merchant developer, I want to simulate payment failures so that I can verify our error handling and reporting.

## Business Value

- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Empower merchants with real-time insights about their Affirm integration
- **Increased Merchant Adoption**: Demonstrate clear ROI for using Affirm
- **Reduced Merchant Churn**: Provide value beyond payment processing
- **Competitive Advantage**: Differentiate from other BNPL providers with superior analytics
- **Merchant Obsession**: Help merchants identify opportunities to improve conversion

## Technical Implementation

The Merchant Analytics Dashboard is implemented as a full-stack application with the following components:

1. **Frontend Application**: A React application with order form and dashboard views
   - Order form for simulating transactions
   - Dashboard for visualizing analytics
   - Support for multiple merchants
   - Ability to simulate payment failures

2. **Backend API**: A serverless API built with Express and AWS Lambda
   - Single Lambda function for all API endpoints
   - Endpoints for order submission and analytics retrieval
   - Real-time data processing

3. **Data Storage**: DynamoDB for order data and S3 for aggregated metrics
   - DynamoDB Streams for real-time event processing
   - S3 for cost-effective storage of aggregated data

4. **Aggregation Engine**: Lambda function triggered by DynamoDB Streams
   - Calculates key metrics like AOV and volume
   - Supports hourly and daily granularities
   - Tracks successful and failed payments separately

5. **Infrastructure**: AWS CDK for infrastructure as code
   - Automated deployment of all components
   - Scalable and cost-effective architecture

## Key Metrics

The dashboard focuses on two primary metrics:

1. **Average Order Value (AOV)**: The average amount spent per transaction
   - Overall AOV
   - AOV by payment plan

2. **Volume**: The number of transactions
   - Total orders
   - Successful orders
   - Failed orders

These metrics are available at both hourly and daily granularities, allowing merchants to analyze both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends.

## Alignment with Affirm's Strategy

This project aligns with Affirm's mission to "deliver honest financial products that improve lives" by:

1. Empowering merchants with transparent data about their Affirm integration
2. Helping merchants optimize their offering to reach more consumers
3. Building trust through data-driven partnership
4. Demonstrating Affirm's commitment to merchant success

By providing merchants with valuable analytics, Affirm strengthens its relationships with its merchant network, which in turn expands the reach of its financial products to more consumers.

## Future Opportunities

While the current implementation focuses on core metrics (AOV and volume), future iterations could expand to include:

1. **Conversion Rate Analysis**: Compare conversion rates with and without Affirm
2. **Customer Segmentation**: Analyze which customer segments prefer which payment plans
3. **Predictive Analytics**: Forecast future transaction volumes and AOV
4. **Competitive Benchmarking**: Compare performance against industry averages
5. **Recommendation Engine**: Suggest optimization opportunities based on data patterns

These enhancements would further strengthen the value proposition for merchants and reinforce Affirm's position as a strategic partner rather than just a payment provider.
